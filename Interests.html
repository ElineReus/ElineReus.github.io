<p><span style="font-size: 20pt; color: #ff6600; font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><strong>Study related interests</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">In september 2017 I started a master in Earth Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. From this year it was possible to follow a new track named 'Future Planet Ecosystem Sciences'. It is the master that follows up the bachelor 'Future Planet Studies, which I studied as well. The track focused until for example on 'grand challenges of human-ecosystem interactions' and 'the empirical cycle'. The latter gave me, amongst others, insight in the importance of open science, fair/transparant data management. The last period of the master is focused on gaining skills related to analysis and modelling. One of the modules a chose was 'general computational skills', which learned me about the unix shell, version control in GitHub, Markdown, OpenRefine and SQL. Building this website was the final project of this course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">In the rest of my studies I would like to learn more about science based environmental management and metropole ecology. It will be subjects of courses, my literature review and hopefully my master thesis. The analysis skills I learned will probably be very usefull during the rest of my masters.</span></p>
