<li><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><em>Abstract:</em>&nbsp;Global warming will cause an increased amount of forest fires in the future* in Eastern Spain. This is important to take into consideration, since forest fires do have an influence on soil quality. Forest fires cause an increase in soil nutrient availability, a decrease in iron availability and lead to an erosion increase, because of a lack of protection by a vegetation cover. Nutrient and iron availability are important for plant nutrition and their elimination by erosion will cause decreased soil fertility. Moreover, erosion rates are as well estimated to increase by higher rain intensity which is expected for the near future. The forest fires induce changes of calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, ammonium, nitrate and crystalline and amorphous iron availability in soil. In this study this is determined by measuring soil samples from a burnt hill and a control hill. The data consist of measured salt, acid and water extracts from respectively crystalline iron, amorphous iron and nutrients. The used samples were taken on different hill locations, at different depths and under canopy as well as in bare soil. Erosion is researched with samples from sediments of the burnt hill slope. The location of the study area is nearby Azu&eacute;bar, a city close to Valencia, in Eastern Spain. Statistical tests, data comparison and comparison with existing literature led to an answer on the research question. The amount of nutrients and iron available for plants appears to be decreased by forest fires in this Mediterranean area. Forest fire is in this research pointed out as a source of soil degradation. Despite the highly fertile ash layers, that originate from fire and increase soil quality because of their high nutrient content, soil quality is defeated by erosion</span></li>

<li><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><em>Abstract:</em> Plastic debris on beaches is considered a world-covering problem (Moret-Ferguson et al., 2010). To understand and describe the environmental impact and moreover discourage continuing the problem on Dutch beaches, an interdisciplinary approach to discuss solutions and attitudes is made in this research. This interdisciplinary approach is based on the collection of empirical data from the populated area around IJmuiden. Sampled plastic from three different beaches, measures of policy makers and the opinions from of civilians, collected by interviews support the findings of this research. To obtain an indication about the plastic abundance in the research area, plastic was sampled on three different beaches; Bloemendaal aan Zee, IJmuiden aan Zee, and Wijk aan Zee belonging to respectively the municipalities of Bloemendaal, Velsen and Beverwijk. For an assessment about political measures interviews with officials were executed with governmental agencies, municipalities and related NGO&rsquo;s of the entire North Sea coast of the Dutch mainland, from Den Helder to Sluis. In the populated area&rsquo;s that belonged to the locations of the beach surveys interviews with the local population were executed, to obtain local attitudes. Contrary to previous beach surveys on the Dutch west coast, conducted by Stichting de Noordzee (Boonstra et al., 2016), the data of this research suggests that the major part of the collected plastics has its origin on land. A part of the interviewed civilians support this finding, suggesting that beachgoers leave plastic debris in large abundances on the beach, and a variety in policies in the questioned municipalities is not improving the situation. As a consequent of this research, it becomes clear that maintaining waste management is a complex system with a large amount of different stakeholders. The societal response in the research area allows improvement, since currently the appropriateness of the measures and attitudes is considered modest. Triggering a self-regulating society is the recommendation that is supported by this research.</span></li>
