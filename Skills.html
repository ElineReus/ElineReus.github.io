<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Relevant and nice things to include</strong></span></p>
<p>On december 7th, 2017, I attended a symposium on Open Science as a part of the course 'The Empirical Cycle'. The day after (December 8th, 2017) I followed a workshop on Reproducible analysis and Research Transparency. <br />*Link to the website of the symposium:* https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/open-science-tools-data-technologies-efficient-ecological-evolutionary-research</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">My computational skills and their relation to my Earth Sciences master</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Course: Analysis and Modelling Lab</strong><br />I have had an introduction in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unix shell and Powershell</li>
<li>(R)Markdown</li>
<li>Version control in GitHub</li>
<li>OpenRefine</li>
<li>Data Organization in spreadsheets</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Building a website with Jekyll and GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a beginner in all of these. I believe that the fact that I know of their existence is very helpful for the rest of my studies (and career). I have the instructions of them and either know or have access to the important basics.</p>
